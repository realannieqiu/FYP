MATLAB Simulations for Final Year Project
Welcome to the repository for MATLAB Simulations for my final year project. This repository contains all the MATLAB scripts, functions, and data files developed during the course of the project. The simulations are designed to solve and analyze [insert a brief project topic, e.g., "Partial Differential Equations on Toroidal Surfaces"], demonstrating the application of numerical methods and advanced mathematical modeling techniques.
